            The approach of this web app
            <span class="green-rise">GREEN RISE</span> is to automate and extend
            the rate of recycling procedure with tech-support and to establish a
            connection among the people and organizations dealing in
            waste-to-product conversion. The residents will be able to know
            about various recycling techniques and waste collection points near
            their locality where they can sell and buy recyclable materials. In
            turn they can make some money with the waste they are going to sell.
            This app includes a domain of users where they can get themselves
            registered. Choose whether they want to buy or sell the waste.
            Select its type and know about the various organizations or
            collection points concerned with that type of waste. The waste type
            and its reusability is finally analyzed and the selling or purchase
            gets confirmed if the waste is worth selling and vice versa. Further
            with help of transportation the waste is reached to its destination
            and then converted to reusable material.
